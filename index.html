    <h1>Subdomain containing all the games for OutRed Games.</h1>
    <h2>To play a game the kinda complicated way, heres how.</h2>
    <h3>The URL should be "cdn.outred.org". To play a game, add a "/yourgame/index.html" to the end of "cdn.outred.org". Instead of putting "yourgame", put the game you want to play. If the game is not on here, it will say 404. Have fun i guess...</h3>
